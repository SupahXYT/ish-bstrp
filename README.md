# iSH Bootstrapping Script
This script makes the very basic iSH enviornment into something more useful (comfier too). It adds openssh, openrc, doas, gcc, and configuration.

## Installation 
Just run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/SupahXYT/ish-bstrp
cd ish-bstrp
chmod +x main.sh
./main.sh
```
It's not completely automatic as it does require you to reboot after installing. 

## Why doas and not sudo?
idk, sudo is bloat
